Hanselman.Forms
===============

The most awesome Hanselman app built in about 4 hours to showcase a sample of [Xamarin.Forms](http://www.xamarin.com/forms). Be sure to read [Scott's](http://www.twitter.com/shanselman) blog: http://www.hanselman.com/blog/XamarinFormsWriteOnceRunEverywhereANDBeNative.aspx


In this sample Hanselman app we show awesome information about the awesome man who is Scott Hanselman including reading in his blog & parsing with XDocument. Additionally, I use Linq2Twitter PCL to grab all of Scott's tweets, all using a nice MVVM Style and nearly 100% code reuse.
